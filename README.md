## Root| Me
Root me is an e-commerce store selling plants, cuttings and other plans associated things. The initial idea for Root me was to sell cuttings instead of a allreday planted plant. This would allow customers to buy p√∂ants at a lower cost, but most importantly grow there own plants.  This projects has been developed as a project for Code Institute's full stack software development course. In this project I am using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, Bootstrap and Python. 

The targeted audience are people who wants to grow their own plants, but also for finding the perfect gift among plant lovers.
In the products section there are ofcourse plants and aslo the basic materials that is needed for working with plants.

## UX
The design of the website has been created to resemble the products. The goal was to create a design that resembled nature.
The colors used on the website are mostly green and white. The white is to keep the overall look of the website clean and adding more focus to the product. In the begining the main background was green, but this took away attention from the products as the images would not stand out from the background. 
To make the product images really pop the background was set to white. The green elements where then added to buttons instead. This created a nice balance that still had the green nature vibe but also would bring the users attention where it should be, at the products.

The green color choosen for the project is called Reseda green, which has a calming green note. Green is a difficult color to work with because to much of it does not create a appeling look. To create a more proffesional look some buttons have black or white background. This created a more organized over all look. 

Most of the text content is black. To be able to prioritaze the content on the website, the content of higher value (ex, product information) was set to black. The content that did not need the users attention straight away (ex, footer) were set to a ashy tone.
