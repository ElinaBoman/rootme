## Root| Me
Root me is an e-commerce store selling plants, cuttings and other plant associated things. The initial idea for Root me was to be selling cuttings instead of a allreday planted plants. This would allow customers to buy plants at a lower cost, but most importantly grow thir own plants. This projects has been developed as a project for Code Institute's full stack software development course. In this project I am using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, Bootstrap and Python. This project was planned with a agile development method.

The targeted audience are people who wants to grow their own plants, but also for finding the perfect gift among plant lovers.

## UX
The design of the website has been created to resemble the main product, plants. The goal was to create a design that was inspired by nature with green and calming tones.
The colors used on the website are mostly green and white. The white is to keep the overall look of the website clean and adding more focus to the product. In the begining the main background was green, but this took away too much attention from the products as the images would not stand out from the background. 
To make the product images really pop the background was set to white, which allowed the beautiful product images to really stand out.
Green elements where instead added to buttons. This created a nice balance that still had the green nature vibe but also would bring the users attention where it should be, at the products.

The green color choosen for the project is called Reseda green, which has a calming green note. Green is a difficult color to work with because to much of it does not create a appeling look. To create a more proffesional look some buttons have black or white background. This created a more organized over all look on the website. 

Most of the text content is black. To be able to prioritaze the content on the website, the content of higher value (ex, product information) was set to black. The content that did not need the users attention straight away (ex, footer) were set to a ashy tone.

## Agile Methodology
In the early stages of the product I started thinking about how to create a user firendly website and how create a proffesional impression. Theese are some of the ares I wrote down. 

Users needs:
- See prices

- Inspiration
- See images of the plants
- Be able to buy pots and other compliments

Features to provide those needs:
- Have prices and information about the plants displayed
- Offer to wrap plants as gifts, have gift cards and small presents that can be attached to the plant
- Show the plants in environments that inspires users to buy the plants
- Have category's for plants, pots and other needs

How to make information easy to understand and available for users:
- With clear descriptive text 
- Easy layout to navigate
- Have filters for users to navigate

How to demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness and
trustworthiness in content:
- Professional language
- No misspellings
- Nice looking pictures that are consistent in style
- Easy to navigate website
- Clear and informative descriptions 
- Links to social medias where users can check out the business
- Have social media platforms where previous buyers can show off their plants


Help users to discover other relevant parts of web application with:
- Links to social medias
- Have a front end that makes users want to stay on the website
- Have features that shows similar plants as the user has been interested in earlier
- Show plants that are suitable in similar environments
### Canban board and issues
This project has been planned with with agile methodology. Before any code was written, issues were created for both users and store owner. The issues represents fictive requirements for users and store owner. The issues were then prioritzed into categories. Good to have, Must have and Nice to have. All issues were not finished, but all Must have were completed.

When I had created theese issues I started to plan the models that I would need in this project to be able to satisfy my issues. I also tried to start thinking about which models should be realted to eachother and what kind of table it would be. Below is an early sketch of my models. They were later modifyied and do not represent the finished product, but the relationship between them stayed the same.

#### SEO
Early in the project development I started reserching and planning search engined optimatization. I wrote down keywords that I thought would be appropriate for a e-commerce selling plants. I tried short- and longtailed words. Some of the shorttailed words were: cuttings, plants, root. A few longtailed words were: Grow plants yourself, Buy plants as presents, cuttings from plants. 
Then I tried reaserching thir relevance and compared it to similar words.
